# Hello!!!

Just thought I should do a brief introduction. My name is Tatyana and I currently work at Netlify as a Frontend Engineer within the Templates team.  

Since I am still pretty new to the team, I am creating this blog as a test of NetlifyCMS and the Astro framework.  I hope to make some design changes to better match my style as well as my current Portfolio site and actually start posting some content to document my journey as a Frontend Engineer. 

If you've made it this far, why?
